Testing the Client
==================

The Javascript client part of Isso is tested by the
`Jest testing framework <https://jestjs.io/>`_.

.. note::
   Improvements to Isso's test coverage and/or different testing strategies are
   always welcome! Please see the :doc:`/docs/contributing/index` page for
   further information.

Unit tests
----------

The unit tests that cover the frontend client ensure that the individual
components are working fine in isolation.

.. note:: Reminder: You can also :ref:`run these tests with Docker
   <testing-docker>` conveniently.

Install the needed ``Jest``-related packages
(listed as ``optionalDependencies`` in ``package.json``):

.. code-block:: bash

   $ npm install

Then run the unit tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ npm run test-unit

You should receive output that looks similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   > test-unit
   > jest --config isso/js/jest-unit.config.js isso/js/tests/unit/

   PASS  isso/js/tests/unit/isso.test.js
   PASS  isso/js/tests/unit/config.test.js
   PASS  isso/js/tests/unit/utils.test.js

End-to-End Integration tests
----------------------------

For the end-to-end integration tests, the Python server part needs to be up and
running - this part of the test suite pretends to be a real user sitting in
front of a keyboard.

.. note:: Reminder: You can also :ref:`run these tests with Docker
   <testing-docker>` conveniently.

The tests are run using the `puppeteer`__ browser automation tool. It runs a
real Chromium browser in the background and can be instrumented to allow
simulation of user interaction.

.. __: https://puppeteer.github.io/puppeteer/

First, ensure all the client files are built and that the server part is ready
to be run. Refer to :ref:`install-from-source` for details. Here's the
important part:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ make init
   $ make js

Start the server and ensure that the comment database is empty:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ mv comments.db comments.db.bak
   $ virtualenv .venv
   $ source .venv/bin/activate
   (.venv) $ isso -c contrib/isso-dev.cfg run

Install the necessary ``puppeteer``-related Javascript packages:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ npm install --no-save jest jest-puppeteer puppeteer

.. note::
   This will take some time as a headless ``chromium`` browser needs to be
   downloaded, which requires about 400Mb of space.

Then run the integration tests:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ npm run tests-integration

You should receive output that looks similar to the following:

.. code-block:: bash

    > test-integration
    > jest --config isso/js/jest-integration.config.js isso/js/tests/integration/

    PASS  isso/js/tests/integration/puppet.test.js
     ✓ window.Isso functions should be idempotent (87 ms)
     ✓ should have correct ISSO_ENDPOINT on page (26 ms)
     ✓ should display "Isso Demo" text on page (34 ms)
     ✓ should fill Postbox with valid data and receive 201 reply (319 ms)

Troubleshooting timeouts
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Are you getting the following error?

.. code-block::

    thrown: "Exceeded timeout of 5000 ms for a hook.
    Use jest.setTimeout(newTimeout) to increase the timeout value, if this is a long-running test."

The **solution** is to run ``make init js`` to re-generate the client files.

**Explanation:** This is actually a very sneaky error and consists
of``puppeteer`` waiting on a non-existent element selector on the page. Open
``http://localhost:8080/demo`` and you'll see that in fact the Isso widget is
not rendering. This type of error can happen if you switch between branches
often and inadvertently have the wrong (incompatible) bundled client
``embed.dev.js``, which is kept between branches because it is ignored via
``.gitignore``.

Skip downloading Chromium
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The downloaded browser will be saved to ``node_modules/puppeteer/.local-chromium/``.
You can set ``PUPPETEER_SKIP_CHROMIUM_DOWNLOAD=true`` in your environment to
skip downloading the bundled browser and instead use the locally installed
version of Chrome/Chromium via e.g. ``PUPPETEER_EXECUTABLE_PATH=$(which chromium)``.

For further information, see `puppeteer docs: Environment variables`__.

.. warning:: Running ``puppeteer`` like this is discouraged as it cannot be
   guaranteed that the versions of Chromium and ``puppeteer`` are in sync. This
   method can save you a lot of disk space and bandwidth, but in case of any
   errors, please retry after clearing ``node_modules`` and re-installing the
   ``puppeteer``-related modules without those environment variables set.

.. __: https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer/blob/main/docs/api.md#environment-variables

Screenshot comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To ensure visual consistency for when somebody e.g. changes the CSS files, the
end-to-end testing suite also checks before-and-after screenshots.
These screenshots are stored in the `integration tests folder`_.

To generate updated screenshots, you must run the following commands.
(For help on setting up Docker, see :ref:`Docker <testing-docker>`)

.. code-block:: console

   $ make docker-generate-screenshots

This will run the test ``isso/js/tests/screenshots/screenshots.test.js`` and output
``.png`` files. Now compare those screenshots against the known-to-be-good
``.hash`` files:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make docker-compare-screenshots

In case you have created a change that causes the resulting images to be
different (and you are sure the visual changes are desired), you need generate
new hashes:

.. code-block:: console

   $ make docker-update-screenshots

Then commit those generated ``.hash`` files in
``isso/js/tests/screenshots/reference/*.png.hash`` to git.

.. warning:: Please only check in hashes rendered through the Docker
   environment as otherwise the screenshots could be skewed by aliasing and
   font rendering settings from your OS.

   Also note that ImageMagick ``identify`` outputs different hash values on
   older Ubuntu versions - another reason to stick to the Docker environment
   for consistency.

Testing standards
-----------------

A good starting point are the `MailChimp standards`__

You may use ``ES6`` syntax in tests (the restriction for ``ES5`` syntax is only
for the production client code which needs to run on as many browsers as
possible).

Try not to introduce any race conditions - especially the asynchronous code is
very tricky to get right.

The current test suite was written largely by one of the main project leads,
who happens to know very little about testing (or even Javascript in general).
Feel free to suggest improvements and change this!

.. _updating-snapshots:

Updating snapshots
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The ``Jest`` tests make use of `snapshots <https://jestjs.io/docs/snapshot-testing>`_. Say you want to ensure that the Postbox ``<textarea>`` always looks like this:

.. code-block:: html

   <div class="isso-textarea-wrapper">
     <div class="isso-textarea isso-placeholder">
         Type Comment Here (at least 3 chars)</div>
     <div class="isso-preview">[...]</div>
   </div>

You *could* write this as:

.. code-block:: javascript

   let expected_html = '<div class="isso-textarea-wrapper> [...]';
   expect($(".isso-textarea-wrapper").innerHTML.toBe(expected_html);

But then your resulting test files would quickly grow quite messy, especially
for large components where the ``expected_html`` block would span whole pages.
That is why ``Jest`` offers to check in those expected blocks as ``snapshots``,
which will saved into e.g. ``isso/js/tests/unit/__snapshots__/*.snap``

.. code-block:: javascript

   expect($(".isso-textarea-wrapper").innerHTML).toMatchSnapshot();

If you have created a commit which changes the HTML that is generated on the
client side (and you're sure it is correct) or written a new test case that
uses snapshots, check in or update the snapshot file by running
``npm run test-unit -- -u`` (or ``npm run test-integration -- -u`` for
integration tests with the dev server running). You should see something like
the following:

.. code-block:: text

   npx jest --config isso/js/jest-unit.config.js isso/js/tests/unit/ -u
   PASS  isso/js/tests/unit/isso.test.js
   › 1 snapshot updated.

Make a new commit for the changes to the snapshot - here's an example:

.. code-block:: text

   isso: tests/unit: Update isso.js snapshot

   Prepending `isso-` to the element classes causes a change in
   the generated HTML and necessitates an update of the
   snapshot.
