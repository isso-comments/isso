Writing Documentation
=====================

The documentation for Isso has several purposes: It should help newcomers have
a good experience in installing and setting up Isso, make it clear how to
configure for several use cases, and invite people to improve the project by
participating.

.. note::
   You may look at the `docs/`_ folder to see how existing documentation is
   written or click the top right **"Edit on GitHub"** button to directly edit
   a page.

.. _docs/: https://github.com/isso-comments/isso/tree/master/docs

Introduction
------------

The documentation for Isso is written using the `Sphinx`__ documentation
project in a markup language called ``reStructuredText`` (``reST``). The
documentation files have have ``.rst`` as a file extension.

``reST`` works a bit like Markdown, but has some differences. Here's an
example:

.. code-block:: rst

    One asterisk: *text* for emphasis (italics),
    Two asterisks: **text** for strong emphasis (boldface), and
    Double backticks: ``text`` for code samples.

.. __: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/

Building the docs
-----------------

You will need to have the latest version of the ``Sphinx`` documentation generator installed
`from PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/Sphinx/>`_.

.. warning:: Please avoid using the version installed by your operating system
   since it may be severely outdated and throw errors with Isso's theme. Isso's
   docs need **at least Sphinx version 4.5.0**.

Install via pip:

.. code-block:: console

   $ virtualenv .venv && $ source .venv/bin/activate
   (.venv) $ pip install sphinx
   (.venv) $ sphinx-build --version
   ~> sphinx-build 4.5.0

Build the docs:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ make site

You can then view the generated docs by starting a local server with
``cd docs/_build/html && python -m http.server`` and visiting ``http://localhost:8000``.

Styles
^^^^^^

The stylesheets of the theme are written in a CSS-like language called
`sass <https://sass-lang.com/guide>`_ and have the ``.scss`` file extension.

If you have made any changes to the stylesheets, you need to install the
`sassc`__ program and then re-generate the CSS file at
``docs/_static/css/site.css``:

.. code-block:: console

   $ apt install sassc
   $ make css

.. __: https://github.com/sass/sassc

How to write reST
-----------------
First and foremost, see the
`reStructuredText Primer <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_.
You can play with a live rST editor at `snippets.documatt.com <https://snippets.documatt.com/>`_.

**Links:**

.. code-block:: rst

    Use `Link text <https://domain.invalid/>`_ for **inline web links**.

    This is a paragraph that contains `a link`_ using **references**.

    .. _a link: https://domain.invalid/

**Headings:**

Headings must always be *underlined* with at least as many characters as the
text is wide.

.. code-block:: rst

   Page title
   ==========

Use page title only once per file (at the top). This is also the name that the
page will appear under.

.. code-block:: rst

   Section heading (h3)
   --------------------

Use section heading to divide page into sections

.. code-block:: rst

   Sub-Heading (h4)
   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Use sub-heading only if necessary - if you need this many levels of headings,
maybe the content chould better be spread out across multiple articles

**Referencing other sections:** (see `:ref:`__)

.. code-block:: rst

    .. _my-reference-label:

    Section to cross-reference
    --------------------------

    This is the text of the section.

    It refers to the section itself, see :ref:`my-reference-label`.

.. __: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#ref-role

**Referencing other documents:** (see `:doc:`__)

.. code-block:: rst

    See also :doc:`/contributing` or :doc:`the news page </news>`

.. __: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html#cross-referencing-documents

**Code blocks:**

Use ``.. code-block:: <language>`` and indent the code by one level:

.. code-block:: rst

   .. code-block:: console

        $ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-virtualenv
        $ virtualenv .venv
        $ source .venv/bin/activate
        (.venv) $ python [cmd]

Syntax standards
----------------

- Use at most three levels of headlines:
  ``===`` for page title, ``---`` for section headings (h3), ``^^^`` for
  sub-headings (h4).
- Use ``$ /usr/bin/command`` to refer to shell commands and use
  ``code-block:: console`` over ``bash`` or ``sh``.
  For actual shell scripts, use ``sh``.
- Use ``(.venv) $ python [cmd]`` for things that need to be run inside a
  virtual environment and be consistent
  (see `Sphinx: Narrative Documentation`__)
- Use ``/path/to/isso/<thing>`` to refer to items inside Isso's installation
  directory or for user data and use ``comments.db`` as the name for the
  database, ``isso.cfg`` (not ``.conf``) for (user) config files.
- Admonitions should only be: ``note``, ``tip``, ``warning``, ``attention``,
  (maybe also ``error``?). See `docutils: Admonitions`__.
- Try to keep line length under 80 characters, but don't worry when going over
  that limit when using links or code blocks
- Use ``.. versionadded::``, ``.. versionchanged::`` and ``.. deprecated::`` to
  make it clear to readers which version of Isso are affected by an
  option or behavior

Inspiration
-----------

The following documentation pages should serve as good examples. They are from
related projects that also offer commenting functionality.

- `Commento Documentation <https://docs.commento.io/>`_, especially the
  `contributing section <https://docs.commento.io/contributing/>`_.
- `Remark42 Documentation <https://remark42.com/docs/getting-started/installation/>`_
- `Schnack Documentation <https://schnack.cool/>`_

A model for good documentation has been laid out by Divio as the
`Divio Documentation System <https://documentation.divio.com/>`_.
It divides docs into four clear areas:

- Tutorials
- How-to guides
- Explanation
- Reference

The `Django docs <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/#how-the-documentation-is-organized>`_
also follow this system.

Other Tips & Tricks
-------------------

Helpful links:

- `Cross-referencing with Sphinx <https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html>`_
- `Sphinx directives <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html>`_
- For theme authors: Look at
  `sphinx-rtd-theme internals <https://sphinx-rtd-theme.readthedocs.io/en/stable/configuring.html>`_

Debugging cross-references:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx docs/_build/html/objects.inv

Also make sure you have used ``:ref:`` or ``:doc``
correctly and not confused the two.

Automatic rebuilds
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For easier docs development through file watching, automatic rebuilding and
refreshing the browser, use `sphinx-autobuild`_:

.. code-block:: console

   (.venv) $ pip install sphinx-autobuild
   (.venv) $ sphinx-autobuild -b dirhtml docs/ docs/_build/html

Then visit ``localhost:8000``

.. _sphinx-autobuild: https://github.com/executablebooks/sphinx-autobuild


.. attention::

   This section of the Isso documentation could be improved. Please help by expanding it.

   Click the ``Edit on GitHub`` button in the top right corner and read the
   GitHub Issue named
   `Improve & Expand Documentation <https://github.com/isso-comments/isso/issues/797>`_
   for further information.

   **What's missing?**

   - How to write good documentation, maybe link to a few guides and example sites
   - More syntax standards, and also correct wrong usage across the docs

   ... and other things about documentation that should be documented.
