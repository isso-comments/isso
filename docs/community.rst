.. note::
   Feel free to **add your own project** that builds on top of or integrates
   Isso in some manner. That way, there will be more data points for
   maintainers to judge if they can afford to make (breaking) changes in Isso's
   internals.

Other options
-------------

Isso is not the only open-source commenting server. You can find an overview at
`lisakov.com: Open source comments <https://lisakov.com/projects/open-source-comments/>`_.

Some popular options are:

* `Commento <https://commento.io/>`_, written in Go. Requires a
  `PostgreSQL <https://www.postgresql.org/>`_ database.

* `Remark42 <https://remark42.com/>`_, written in Go.

* `Staticman <https://staticman.net/>`_, written in Node.js. Adds comments
  directly to repository of static sites.

* `schnack <https://schnack.cool/>`_, written in Node.js.
