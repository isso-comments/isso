# Isso – a commenting server similar to Disqus

Isso – *Ich schrei sonst* – is a lightweight commenting server written in
Python and JavaScript. It aims to be a drop-in replacement for
[Disqus](http://disqus.com).

## Features

- **Comments written in Markdown**  
  Users can edit or delete own comments (within 15 minutes by default).
  Comments in moderation queue are not publicly visible before activation.
- **SQLite backend**  
  *Because comments are not Big Data.*
- **Disqus & WordPress Import**  
  You can migrate your Disqus/WordPress comments without any hassle.
- **Configurable JS client**  
  Embed a single JS file, 65kB (20kB gzipped) and you are done.

See **[isso-comments.de](https://isso-comments.de/)** for a **live demo**, more
details and [documentation](https://isso-comments.de/docs/).
