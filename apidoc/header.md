### Conventions

This documenation uses `https://comments.example.com` as the base URL for Isso's API.

For your installation, this URL will be different. Make sure to substitute the
example URL for the URL you load your `embed.min.js` from.

E.g. `https://example.com/isso/js/embed.min.js` would result in a base URL of
`https://example.com/isso`.
